# Checking BRIDGES Assignment Features

1. Run all the tests in each language (using the scripts)

	a) Open each visualization. For each visualization

		(i) Check if zoom and pan works 
		(2) Check all buttons on right sidebar - toggle buttons for node
			and link labels, Reset view and Hide nodes/labels - these are mostly
			for node-link visualizations
		(3) Line charts -- mouse over the labels of each chart and make 
			sure the remaining charts are made more transparent

Not working, to fix:
	a) Reset View
	b) Link Label -- is printed as Link Label in large font!
	c) Need to check graphs - large graphs - labels are not displayed
	e) consider modifying keys: 'n' for node labels, 'l' for link labels
	f) Hide nodes, links is not implemented on all tree structures? (not there for
		general tree)
	g) node labels are permanent in bst?
	h) bridges grid tutorials -- use a better image in gallery
